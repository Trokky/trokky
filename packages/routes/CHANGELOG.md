### Patch Changes

- 9a7f248: Replace direct console statements with proper logger system

  All console.log, console.warn, and console.error statements have been replaced with the unified logger system for better log control and consistency.

  Changes:
  - @trokky/core: Added loggers to media processors (sharp, cloudflare-transform-store, workers-images)
  - @trokky/routes: Replaced console statements in slug validation and auth endpoints with logger calls
  - @trokky/express: Added loggers to adapter and media-rewrite-middleware
  - @trokky/adapter-postgres-data: Changed connection pool logs from info to debug level

  Benefits:
  - Consistent logging format across all packages
  - Logs can be controlled via log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
  - Reduced log noise in production environments

- Updated dependencies [9a7f248]
  - @trokky/core@0.1.4

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- Fix critical security vulnerabilities in password reset and mail system

  **Security Fixes:**
  1. **Removed plain text passwords from event system** - Passwords are no longer logged in events, preventing exposure in logs and event storage
  2. **Constant-time token comparison** - Password reset tokens now use constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks
  3. **Unified password validation** - Reset flow now enforces same strong password requirements as change password
  4. **Rate limiting on password reset** - Added rate limiting to prevent abuse, spam, and enumeration attacks

  **New Features:**
  - `TrokkyCore.onUserCreatedWithPassword()` - Secure callback for sending temporary passwords without logging
  - `TrokkyCore.checkRateLimit()` - Public method for routes to use rate limiter

  **Breaking Changes:**
  - `MailNotificationService` now requires `core` parameter in config for secure callback registration

  **Migration Guide:**

  Update your MailNotificationService initialization:

  ```typescript
  // Before:
  new MailNotificationService(eventBus, {
    mailService,
    baseUrl: 'https://example.com',
    // ...
  })

  // After:
  new MailNotificationService(core.events, {
    mailService,
    baseUrl: 'https://example.com',
    core, // Required for secure callback registration
    // ...
  })
  ```

### Patch Changes

- Remove restrictive slug validation in checkSlugUniqueness endpoint

  The slug uniqueness check was using a rigid regex that rejected valid slugs,
  causing backup/restore failures. Now only validates non-empty slugs, allowing
  the schema field definition to handle format validation.
